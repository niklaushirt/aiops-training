## Official Troubleshooting Documentation



The official IBM [Troubleshooting Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.5.0?topic=troubleshooting) is probably a safe place to start.



## Check your installation 

Run the following tool:

```bash
./tools/11_check_install.sh
```

This might give you some pointers as to why your instance is misbehaving.
