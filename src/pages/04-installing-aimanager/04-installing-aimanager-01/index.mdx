Now it's time to create the AIManager instance.\
To do this create an instance of the AI Manager custom resource called ibm-cp-watson-aiops with `size: small` as we'll use this only for the training and not for production (see note below).

1. Run the following command to create an instance of AIManager.

   ```yaml
   cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
   apiVersion: orchestrator.aiops.ibm.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Installation
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cp-watson-aiops
     namespace: cp4waiops
   spec:
     enableConnectionModule: true
     imagePullSecret: ibm-entitlement-key
     license:
       accept: true
     pakModules:
     - name: aiopsFoundation
       enabled: true
     - name: applicationManager
       enabled: true
     - name: aiManager
       enabled: true
     - name: connection
       enabled: true
     size: small
     storageClass: ibmc-file-gold-gid
     storageClassLargeBlock: ibmc-block-gold
   EOF  
   ```



> This creates the `Installation` instance that the Operator will pick up and start the installation.
