### Check if the Operator is ready



## üöÄ TASK: Verify that the Operator is running
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.5.0?topic=manager-starter-installation-cli" target="_blank" >üåè Documentation for the Task</a>


Check that the Operator is running and that you can continue with the next chapter to install CP4WAIOPS. You can do this by listing the ClusterServiceVersions (csv) for the `cp4waiops` Namespace.

* Either run the following:
	
```bash
oc get csv -n cp4waiops                                                           
```
	
And you should see TODO entries with `Succeeded` state
